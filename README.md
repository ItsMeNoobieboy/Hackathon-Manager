# Hackathon Manager

Welcome to Hackathon Manager, an app to make your hackathons a smoother process! This app allows hackathon participants register, fill out any necessary forms, and get the most up-to-date information from hackathon organizers, all in one app!

### This is heavily a WIP, and in it's current state, lacks many of the features the final app will. Right now, the app only features HacKnight, a hackathon I helped host at BB&N this past June, for easier development, but in the future, it will be accessible to all hackathons. To use the app at its current stage, you will have to download the Xcode files and run it with the iOS simulator. However, if it were final, it would look like this:

## (To come) Home Page
The page where participants can get information at a glance. View the latest announcement, the current scheduled event, and how much time remaining in the hackathon.

## Schedule Page
View the events scheduled for the hackathon and where you are during the day.

## (To come) Misc Page
The page for everything except the schedule and registration. Access files, sign waivers, submit forms, view past announcements, message organizers, check-in and check-out, and more! This page contains the small, one-off tasks users need to do to attend the hackathon.

## (Half-implemented) Profile/Registration Page
The sign-in page allows users to register, provide their necessary information, and update them as necessary.
> Currently, you can only create an account, log in, and log out.
